# Car Sales Analysis
### 1.	Project Title / Headline
Car Sales Analysis<br>
An interactive dashboard designed to analyze Year-To-Date (YTD) car sales across company, model, engine type, transmission, color, and body style—empowering business users with actionable insights into sales performance, revenue, and customer preferences.

### 2.	Short Description / Purpose
The Car Sales Analysis Dashboard is an interactive Power BI report that helps users explore and compare car sales based on company, model, engine type, transmission, color, and body style. The data was collected and prepared using SQL before being visualized in Power BI. The dashboard tracks Year-to-Date (YTD) and Month-to-Date (MTD) sales, revenue, and total cars sold, allowing users to compare current performance with last year. This tool helps sales teams, analysts, and car companies understand sales trends, revenue growth, and customer preferences for better business decisions.

### 3.	Tech Stack
The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:<br>
•	 Power BI Desktop – Main data visualization platform used for report creation.<br>
•	 Ms Excel – Data transformation and cleaning layer for reshaping and preparing the data.<br>
•	 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Used for calculated measures, dynamic visuals, and conditional logic.<br>
•	 SQL (Structured Query Language) – Used to retrieve, filter, and aggregate car sales data from the database before importing it into Power BI.

### 4.	Data Source
The dataset used in this project was taken from Kaggle.
It contains 23,916 rows and 16 columns, providing detailed information about car sales, including company, model, engine type, transmission, color, body style, sale price, and total revenue.


### 5.	Features / Highlights
•	Business Problem<br>
The company lacks a centralized system to monitor Year-to-Date (YTD) and Month-to-Date (MTD) sales performance. As a result, management cannot easily evaluate revenue trends, identify best-selling models, or compare performance with last year to plan effective marketing and production strategies.

•	Goal of the Dashboard<br>
The goal of this dashboard is to monitor Year-to-Date (YTD) and Month-to-Date (MTD) performance of sales, revenue, and total cars sold across different dimensions such as company, model, transmission type, and body style. This helps users analyze trends, compare performance, and make informed business decisions.

-	 Filter Panel<br>
An interactive slicer allows users to filter all visuals by selected attributes such as company, model, transmission type, body style, and color—enabling focused analysis based on user preference.<br>
-	YTD Weekly Sales Anaylsis (Line Chart)
A line chart displays weekly car sales, showing which week recorded the highest number of cars sold along with their total revenue. This helps identify peak sales periods, understand seasonal demand trends, and measure performance over time.
-	YTD Total Price by Body Style (Donut Chart)<br>
A donut chart displays which body style (such as SUV, Sedan, Hatchback, etc.) contributes the most to overall revenue. This helps identify which car body type generates higher sales value and is more preferred by customers.
-	YTD Total Price By Color (Donut Chart)
A donut chart displays which color (such as Red,Pale White and Black) contributes the most to overall revenue. This helps identify which car color generates higher sales value and is more preferred by customers.
-	 Company Performance Analysis (Matrix)<br>
A matrix visual compares each company’s car sales for the current year versus the previous year. It also displays key metrics such as YTD average car price, YTD average cars sold, and the percentage change in average cars sold. This helps identify which companies improved their sales performance, maintained stable growth, or experienced a decline compared to last year.
-Cy Total Sales By Month (Stacked Column Chart)
A Stacked Column chart displays weekly car sales, showing which Month recorded the highest number of cars sold along with their total revenue. This helps identify peak sales periods, understand seasonal demand trends, and measure performance over time.
